This project shows data exploration and summarization using visualization and statistical toos, such as distributions of the variables and correlations. 
In this exploration, I will investigate Red Wine dataset, which has 1599 observations with a output variable “quality”, which is scored from 3 (worst) to 8 (best), and 11 input variables: fixed.acidity (tartaric acid - g/dm^3), volatile.acidity (acetic acid - g/dm^3), citric.acid (g/dm^3), residual.sugar (g/dm^3), chlorides (sodium chlorides - g/dm^3), free.sulfur.dioxide (mg/dm^3), total.sulfur.dioxide (mg/dm^3), density (g/dm^3), pH, sulphates (potassium sulphate - g/dm^3), and alcohol (% by volume).

This project is completed by language R.
